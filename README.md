# Ansible Playground
This repository explores the automation capabilities of Ansible. It contains examples, configurations, and playbooks for server provisioning, application deployment, and system management. The goal is to demonstrate Ansibleâ€™s efficiency in streamlining infrastructure tasks.


### Instructions
To run a playbook enter the following commands, using simple_webpage_play.yaml as an example:

    $ cd /ansible/ansible_quickstart/
    $ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini simple_webage_play.yaml --ask-become-pass

Note: replace simple_webpage_play.yaml with the playbook YAML file of your choosing.
